PROJECT DEMO :-

This is a simple web-based number guessing game. The player sets a maximum number, and the game generates a random number within that range. The player then tries to guess the correct number, receiving hints whether their guess is too high or too low. The game displays messages guiding the player and also allows them to quit at any time. The randomly generated number is also logged in the browser's console for testing purposes.
